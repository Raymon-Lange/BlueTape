Title: BlueTape - A Platform Starter App based on Pygame

Description:
BlueTape provides base classes for building a platform video game, including features such as blocks, fonts, sprites, collision detection, and scoring. It is built with Pygame, a popular Python library for creating games and multimedia applications. This repository offers a comprehensive implementation of BlueTape, enabling users to quickly build a platformer game with ease. Whether you're an aspiring artist or a seasoned developer looking to explore Pygame's capabilities, BlueTape provides an engaging and creative environment to bring your game ideas to life.

Build Script:
To build and run BlueTape, follow the steps outlined below. Please ensure that you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Raymon-Lange/BlueTape.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd BlueTape
```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
- For Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- For macOS/Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
